# Spriter Data API - ex2D 

### Overview

The **[Spriter Data API](https://github.com/Thinksquirrel-Software/spriterdapi-unity)** is an object model in C# that follows the SCML (Spriter Character Markup Language) specification. It abstracts reading from an SCML file, allowing developers to easily integrate Spriter into their own applications.

For more information about Spriter, please visit <http://brashmonkey.com/spriter.htm>

This version of the API is written for the Unity game engine (<http://unity3d.com>).

This repository includes the ex2D implementation of the Data API.
